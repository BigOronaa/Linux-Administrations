# Advanced Shell Scripting Project

**Objective:** Automate system administration tasks using advanced shell scripting techniques in Linux.

---

## üß† Objective
I developed an advanced shell script to monitor and automate system health checks in Linux ‚Äî tracking CPU usage, memory consumption, disk space, and top processes, while optionally setting up email alerts for critical thresholds.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps and Implementation

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Created the Health Check Script**
I created a script named `health_check.sh` to check essential system metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk usage.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "CPU Usage: $(top -bn1 | grep load | awk '{print $12}')"
echo "Memory Usage: $(free -m | awk '/Mem:/ {print $3 " MB used"}')"
echo "Disk Usage: $(df -h / | awk '/\// {print $5 " used"}')"
echo "Top 5 Processes:"
ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head -n 6
```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Made the Script Executable**
I granted the script execution permissions with:

```bash
chmod +x health_check.sh
```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Executed the Script**
I ran the script to check real-time system performance metrics:

```bash
./health_check.sh
```

### I added Screenshots

This displayed details like CPU load, memory usage, and the top five CPU-consuming processes.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Scheduled Hourly Execution via Cron**
I scheduled the script to automatically run every hour and log results for monitoring purposes:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Then I added this line:

```bash
0 * * * * /path/to/health_check.sh >> /var/log/health_check.log
```

This ensured the system health was logged regularly for review.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Added Email Alerts for High CPU Usage**
I enhanced the script to send an email if CPU usage exceeded 90%. This feature helps maintain awareness of performance issues before they impact system operations.
